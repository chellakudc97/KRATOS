# KRATOS

##Breast Cancer Detection Using KRATOS
This repository contains the implementation of the KRATOS algorithm for analyzing and detecting breast cancer from MRI, CT, and Ultrasound images. The project includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization techniques.

Overview
This project uses the KRATOS algorithm to classify medical images as healthy or sick (cancerous). The repository includes methods to preprocess images, train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and visualize results using t-SNE and saliency maps.
